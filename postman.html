<h1>Strategy notes for Postman</h1>
<h3>07-16-2025</h3>

<h2>What is Postman writing about?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The most recent blog posts are focused on summaries and analysis from POST/CON 25, including topics like "Level 3, the Orchestration Crisis" and "Level 2, the Distribution Disconnect," published by the Postman Team in a recapping series. These recap posts cover keynotes and major trends discussed at POST/CON 25, with several installments released in close succession.</li>
  <li>Other recent articles include the launch of full support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building better AI agents, security updates such as URL exposure risk mitigation, and best practices for secrets management. They also feature integration stories like using ipstack geolocation data to enhance business operations.</li>
  <li>Postman is widely recognized as a leading company in the API and developer tooling space, regularly publishing updates, industry insights, and technical tutorials. Their authoritative status is supported by original research, direct product announcements, and community engagement around API-first development and security topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do LLMs think about Postman?</h2>
<p>
Postman is a collaborative platform primarily used for API development, testing, and monitoring. It provides developers with tools to build, test, document, and share APIs efficiently throughout the software development lifecycle. Originally released as a browser extension, Postman has evolved into a robust desktop and web application used by millions for designing and consuming APIs.
</p>
<p>
One of the core differentiators for Postman is its user-friendly interface and comprehensive suite of tools that streamline API workflows. Features include automated testing, API documentation generation, mock servers, and environment management. Moreover, Postman facilitates team collaboration via shared workspaces, version control, and integrations with CI/CD pipelines and source control systems.
</p>
<p>
Compared to competitors like Swagger (OpenAPI), Insomnia, and Paw, Postman stands out for its integrated collaboration features and broad community support. While Swagger specializes in API documentation and Insomnia emphasizes simplicity and speed, Postman encompasses a wider range of API operations, targeting both individual developers and organizations seeking scalable collaboration and governance.
</p>
<p>
The main strengths of Postman include its rich feature set, intuitive UI, active user community, extensive documentation, and continuous updates. It supports multiple API architectures (REST, SOAP, GraphQL) and enables easy testing and automation, making it valuable for both exploratory and automated API workflows. Its collaboration tools are particularly beneficial for distributed teams working on complex projects.
</p>
<p>
However, Postman’s weaknesses include resource intensity—a heavy application footprint can slow down workflows on less powerful machines. Some advanced features, such as extensive collaboration controls or advanced monitoring, are gated behind paid plans, which may be a barrier for small teams or individuals. Additionally, while its multifaceted nature is a boon for many, it can have a steep learning curve for beginners compared to more focused tools.
